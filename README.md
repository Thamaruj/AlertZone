# 🚨 Alert Zone  
### *Citizen-Driven Safety & Infrastructure Reporting Platform*


**AlertZone** is a cross-platform solution designed to bridge the communication gap between citizens and municipal authorities in Sri Lanka. By leveraging mobile technology and real-time data, it empowers residents to report non-emergency infrastructure hazards such as potholes, blocked drains, and unsafe construction directly to the relevant authorities for faster resolution.

The project is currently slated for a pilot deployment in the Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council.
